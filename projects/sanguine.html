                    A two-player strategy card game inspired by Queen's Blood from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
                    Players compete for territorial control across a 3×5 board, placing cards from their own decks
                    onto cells that they own via pawns. Each card spreads influence to adjacent territories based on its
                    unique
                    mini-grid pattern. Victory goes to whoever controls the most valuable rows when the board fills or
                    both players consecutively pass which creates a delicate balance of expansion, defense, and resource
                    management.

                <p>
                    The original implementation for this Sanguine Game is built in <strong>Java</strong> following
                    strict
                    Model-View-Controller architecture. The model manages all game state and rules, views
                    render the board (both text-based and Swing GUI), and controllers handle player input
                    through a listener-based event system.
                </p>

                <div class="features">
                    <div class="feature">
                        <strong>mvc architecture</strong>: Complete separation between game logic (BasicSanguine model),
                        display (SwingSanguineView, TextBoardView), and input handling (SanguineController).
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <strong>listener pattern</strong>: The model notifies observers via ModelStatusListener
                        and PlayerActionListener interfaces, enabling loose coupling between components.
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <strong>strategy pattern</strong>: AI opponents implement SanguineStrategy interface.
                        Multiple strategies available: FillFirst (greedy), MaximizeRowScore (tactical),
                        Minimax (optimal), and composite FallbackStrategy.

                    <div class="feature">
                        <strong>influence system</strong>: Cards define 5×5 influence grids where 'I' marks
                        pawn placement, 'C' is center, and 'X' is empty. Teal's grid is mirrored horizontally
                        for symmetric gameplay.

                <p>
                    The game uses an event-driven architecture where the model broadcasts state changes
                    to registered listeners. The controller implements both ModelStatusListener (for turn
                    changes and game-over events) and PlayerActionListener (for card placement and passing).
                    Views subscribe to updates and re-render accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Player abstraction supports both HumanPlayer (awaits GUI input) and MachinePlayer
                    (computes moves via strategy). This enables human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI
                    game modes with identical underlying logic.
