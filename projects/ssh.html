                    This is my website, but accessible over SSH. When you connect to port 22, you receive a
                    version of my homepage at <a href="https://vedsite.com">vedsite.com</a>, but in the terminal.
                    I tried to be consistent with the DVD-player-esque animation style, with the squares bouncing off
                    the
                    edge.
                    Each square maps to a different section of my portfolio (about, projects, experience, misc) and
                    morphs
                    into a different character every time it hits a wall. You can press 1 through 4 on your keyboard to
                    navigate into
                    each section, or just sit by and watch the square bounce around (don't sit idle too long, I have a
                    timeout set for 10 minutes).

                        across the terminal, with each square color-coded to a specific page. Pink = about, purple =
                        projects, blue = experience, teal = misc. The numbers and colors match the ones on my website
                        homepage

                        original

                        the squares bounce
                        around in. The text is offset per row so it reads diagonally, and the squares render on top of

                    The app is written in Go using the Charm stack which a set of GitHub libraries specifically built
                    for terminal UIs over SSH.
                    <strong>Wish</strong> handles the SSH server: it listens on port 22 and bootstraps a
                    fresh terminal UI for each incoming connection.
                    <strong>Bubble Tea</strong> is the TUI framework that drives the render loop:
                    an <code>Init → Update → View</code> cycle running at 50ms ticks for smooth animation.
                    <strong>Lip Gloss</strong> handles all the styling including colors, bold text, positioning in the
                    terminal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The animation loop works like a simple physics engine: each square has an (x, y) position
                    and a velocity vector (vx, vy). With every tick, positions update and bounce off of terminal edges.
                    On collision, the square's character morphs to the next one in the cycle.

                <p>
                    The Go binary runs inside a Docker container on my AWS EC2 instance in Ohio. I chose Docker for easy
                    deployment and isolation, I was able to quickly build the Go binary, drop it in the container, and
                    run
                    it without worrying about Go versions or library conflicts on the host machine. The container runs a
                    Wish
                    SSH server that listens on port 22, and every incoming SSH connection spawns a new instance of the
                    Bubble
                    Tea UI. Port 22 is mapped to the container, so <code>ssh portfolio.vedsite.com</code>
                    routes
                    directly into the Wish server. My admin SSH runs on a different port to prevent disparity and so the
                    portfolio
                    can own port 22. Cloudflare handles DNS as an A record on DNS-only mode since SSH cannot be proxied
                    on the free tier.
