                <p>
                    This is my website, but accessible over SSH. When you connect to port 22, you receive a 
                    version of my homepage at <a href="https://vedsite.com">vedsite.com</a>, but in the terminal.
                    I tried to keep consistent to the DVD-player-esque animation style, with the shapes bouncing and hitting the edges.
                    Each shape maps to a section of my portfolio (about, projects, experience, misc) and morphs
                    into a different character every time it hits a wall. You can press 1 through 4 on your keyboard to navigate into 
                    each section, or just sit by and watch the shapes bounce around (don't sit idle too long, i have a timeout set for 10 minutes).
                </p>

            <!-- HOW IT'S BUILT -->
            <section>
                <h2>how it's built</h2>
                <p>
                    the app is written in Go using the Charm stack — a set of libraries purpose-built for
                    terminal UIs over SSH.
                </p>

                <div class="tech-tags">
                    <span>Go</span>
                    <span>Wish</span>
                    <span>Bubble Tea</span>
                    <span>Lip Gloss</span>
                    <span>Docker</span>
                    <span>AWS EC2</span>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Wish</strong> handles the SSH server — it listens on port 22 and bootstraps a
                    fresh terminal UI for each incoming connection.
                    <strong>Bubble Tea</strong> is the TUI framework that drives the render loop:
                    an <code>Init → Update → View</code> cycle running at 50ms ticks for smooth animation.
                    <strong>Lip Gloss</strong> handles all the styling — colors, bold text, positioning — in the terminal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    the animation loop works like a simple physics engine: each shape has an (x, y) position
                    and a velocity vector (vx, vy). every tick, positions update and bounce off terminal edges.
                    on collision, the shape's character morphs to the next in the cycle.
                </p>

            <!-- ARCHITECTURE -->

                <div class="arch-row">
                    <span class="node">your terminal</span>
                    <span class="arrow">→</span>

                <p>
                    the Go binary runs inside a Docker container on my AWS EC2 instance.
                    port 22 on the host is mapped to the container, so <code>ssh ssh.vedsite.com</code>
                    routes directly into the Wish server. my admin SSH runs on a different port so the
                    portfolio can own port 22. Cloudflare handles DNS (A record, DNS-only mode — SSH
                    can't be proxied).

                    the code is on my GitHub. the main logic is a single <code>main.go</code> file —
                    model, update loop, view renderer, and SSH server setup all in ~230 lines.
