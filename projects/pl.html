                <p>
                    A data science project exploring whether online media presence affects soccer team performance.
                    We analyzed 59 Premier League matches across five top teams (Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, 
                    Manchester City, Chelsea) to determine if the number of news articles published between games 
                    could predict goals scored. Using Selenium web scraping for ESPN match data and The Guardian API 
                    for article counts, we built linear and polynomial regression models to test this hypothesis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spoiler:</strong> The models found no predictive relationship (negative R² scores), 
                    suggesting media coverage follows success rather than causes it.

                <h2>match window logic</h2>
                <p>
                    The core challenge was attributing articles to the correct game. We defined a "match window" 
                    as the period between one game's end time and the next game's start time. Any article published 
                    within this window counts toward the upcoming match's pre-game coverage.
                </p>

                <div class="arch-row">
                    <span class="node">Game N ends</span>
                    <span class="arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="node">Window opens</span>
                    <span class="arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="node">Articles counted</span>
                    <span class="arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="node">Game N+1 starts</span>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This approach captures the media narrative between matches—post-match analysis of Game N 
                    and preview coverage for Game N+1. The assumption is that this combined coverage could 
                    influence team morale, fan expectations, or perceived pressure.

                    We tested whether article count (X) could predict goals scored (y) using two regression approaches:

                        Test MSE: 2.38, R² = -0.1087. The negative R² means predicting the mean would be more accurate.

                    <div class="feature">
                        <strong>polynomial regression (degree 2)</strong>: Added a quadratic term to capture

                    Both models performed worse than a naive baseline (predicting mean goals for every match). 
                    The negative R² scores definitively show that article count alone has no predictive power 
                    for team performance.

                <h2>ethical considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    If a strong relationship existed, it could imply media coverage affects player performance—raising 
                    questions about fair competition. Teams with larger fanbases generate more articles, which could 
                    create feedback loops where popular teams get predicted to win, receive more coverage, and become 
                    even more popular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, using article counts disadvantages smaller clubs with less media presence, potentially 
                    making predictions less accurate for them regardless of actual performance quality.
