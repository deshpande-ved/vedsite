                    An interactive simulation game that models carbon emissions across five Boston neighborhoods. 
                    Players race against time to reduce CO2 levels by planting eelgrass and converting car commuters 
                    to public transit. The game visualizes how policy decisions and environmental interventions 
                    can impact urban carbon footprints, with neighborhoods changing color based on their emission levels.

                    The eelgrass mechanic is based on real research into <strong>Blue Carbon</strong> ecosystems. 
                    Coastal ecosystems like eelgrass beds sequester significant amounts of CO2. According to 
                    <a href="https://seagrant.mit.edu/2023/10/19/mapping-blue-carbon-new-report-highlights-coastal-ecosystem-benefits/">MIT Sea Grant research</a>, 
                    Massachusetts' 218,222 acres of coastal ecosystems sequester approximately 7.5 million metric 
                    tonnes of carbon — roughly 34 tonnes per acre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The emission calculations assume that non-public-transit commuters drive cars, each producing 
                    approximately 2.9 tonnes of CO2 annually (based on average commute distances and vehicle efficiency). 
                    While simplified, this model demonstrates the real tension between transportation choices and 
                    environmental impact.

                    Built in <strong>Racket</strong> using the Intermediate Student Language with Lambda (ISL+), 
                    this project uses the <code>big-bang</code> framework for reactive game programming. 
                    The game state is a struct containing the list of neighborhoods and elapsed time, 
                    updated through pure functional transformations on each tick, key press, or mouse click.

                    The <code>big-bang</code> loop follows a simple cycle: the current world state 
                    (neighborhoods + timer) passes through event handlers (tick/key/mouse), which 
                    return a new state. The draw function renders this state to the screen. 
                    The <code>stop-when</code> clause checks for win (any neighborhood at 0 carbon) 
                    or lose (15+ seconds elapsed) conditions after each update.
