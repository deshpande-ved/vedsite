                    My coach enforced my love for sports when he advised my parents to switch me to inline roller skates at 4.
                    I played a variety of sports growing up, but Roller Skating was special. I competed internationally in Belgium in 2014 
                    and Hong Kong in 2016, where I ended up winning. The pandemic hindered skating practices, but helped me find Squash
                    in May 2024. Ever since, I've used it as a tool for mental and physical development, playing at least thrice a week.
                    When I tried out for the team at Northeastern in Fall 2024, my unrefined skills denied me the spot. I went back to the drawing
                    board and finally made the team Spring 2025. Once Harrison Seeley (former Vice President) graduated this past December, I was honored
                    to assume the role in his stead, starting Spring 2026. Harrison's efforts contributed to the birth of <a href="https://neusquashhub.com">neusquashhub.com</a>:
                    a full-stack web app with live attendance service and cloud emails and scheduling. After taking over, my efforts 
                    went into improving the website and building new features like announcements and improving scheduling features.

                <div class="arch-row">
                    <span class="node">React Frontend</span>
                    <span class="arrow">→</span>

                </div>

                <p>
                    SquashHub follows the traditional full stack architecture: React frontend sends RESTful API calls 
                    to an Express.js backend, which executes ACID-compliant CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. 
                    Schema reaches the third normal form by separating inter-table many-to-many relationships into junction tables.
                    Additional table indexing except primary key is not needed (and won't be for the future, unless we get 150 users)
                    due to the simple schema and small amount of data size. <br>
                    I chose to implement the Docker container and Flask API on AWS EC2 after learning it to take this website over.
                    That's the one that runs the live updating <a href="https://vedsite.com/misc">misc page</a>, btw.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everything: frontend, backend and database, runs on a single AWS EC2 VM. Not optimal but it is more than
                    enough for what Club Squash currently needs. Cloudflare DNS is used to proxy incoming HTTPS requests
                    and forwards them to the EC2 instance over HTTP. A custom reverse proxy server routes all the requests
                    between frontend and backend on the same origin, to eliminate any chance of CORS issues.
                </p>

            </section>

            <!-- attendance service -->
            <section>
                <h2>attendance service</h2>
                <p>
                    The attendance service runs in memory as a custom class within the backend process. When an admin 
                    starts the service, it generates a random 4-digit alphanumeric code and sets an "active" flag to true. 
                    Players submit codes through the frontend; correct codes create positive attendance records in the database.
                    The "Mark Unattended as Absent" when clicked by an admin, creates negative records. It also queries for users
                    that did not enter the attendance code therefore do not have a positive record for that calendar day, and creates
                    negative records there as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This architecture is simple but comes with tradeoffs. Running the service in memory makes the backend 
                    stateful, which complicates horizontal scaling—each server would need to synchronize attendance states. 
                    Using calendar-day logic also creates edge cases: what if two events happen on the same day? what if an 
                    event runs past midnight? what if someone's in a different timezone during a virtual event? 
                    These scenarios are outside the current use case, but the date-based logic remains a bottleneck for future features.

            <!-- authentication -->
            <section>
                <h2>authentication</h2>
                <p>
                    Passwords are one-way encrypted using <code>bcrypt</code> and stored in the player table so that sensitive 
                    data is <strong>never</strong> written to disk in plaintext. While the UI hides admin controls from non-admin users, 
                    it is still possible for someone to spoof requests with an admin username. To prevent this, all POST, PUT, PATCH, and 
                    DELETE requests require an authorization token. This token is randomly generated and sent to an admin 
                    after successful password verification. The backend follows active tokens in a ring buffer, ensuring 
                    only recent tokens remain valid and old ones don't pile up or become a liability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This setup works for now, but migrating to OAuth via Auth0 or Firebase would provide industry-standard 
                    authentication with features like Single Sign-On (SSO). That's a good area for future developers to improve.
                </p>

                    This SquashHub website was designed to be an evolving platform that can grow with the team's needs. As Harrison helped me with the transition
                    to take it over, I have opened the codebase to all Club Squash members, so anyone who's interested can contribute new features, 
                    fix bugs, and improve the platform over time. Any developer can make their own branch, push their local changes on there &
                    create a pull request that I can view and analyze. Since we are all pretty busy with college and this was made as a passion
                    project that does in fact have a lot of potential, we arrange meetings before squash practices in the evenings to discuss 
                    goals and concerns so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After taking over as lead developer, I oversee all contributions and perform code reviews, test new features, manage deployments 
                    to production, and help onboard new developers to the codebase architecture. I also manage all of the production server, 
                    the virtual machine, domain, and service accounts for third-party integrations.
